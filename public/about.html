<p>My name is John Aghato, I am 29 years old and this is my first ever class on web development. 
  I am an international PE teacher and I love sports, technology and teaching</p>

<p>I was born and grew up in Tanzania, a beautiful country in East Africa. I got my Bachelors' degree in Physical education and sports sciences, from the University of Dar es salaam Tanzania.
  I moved to Mexico a year ago and I like it so far, people are nice and the food is amazing. I am currently teaching PE at an international school in Santa Fe area. I am currently taking my Postgraduate in Elementary Education from the University of Alabama.

<p>I am interested in coding because I like solving problems and one of the best feelings is when I figure out something that has been stressing me for a while
  I think everyone should learn how to code because, coding build descpline, patience, resilience and focus.
  My goal is to start a career in development so that I can solve big problems, make more money, and be able to avoid long commutes to work while being able to work from anywhere.
