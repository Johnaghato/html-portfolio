<h1>The Best Movies According to John</h1>
 <h2>My Top 3 Movies</h2>
 <hr />
 <h3>Apocalypto</h3>
    <p>This is my all time favourite movie. From the beggining to the end there is no boring scene or any part that is not entertaining. This is the movie that I have repeatedly watched the most</p>
    <h3>Peaky Blinders</h3>
    <p>I like the brotherhood and how the family supported eachother through thin and thick. In this 60 episodes series devided into 6 seasons, I like the wisdom and leadership of Thomas who was fearless, brave and a family man who supported his family and friends. </p>
    <h3>Luca</h3>
 <p>This is my favourate anime movie. I like the friendship and how Alberto supported Luca and welcomed him to the family. Although he was just a sea monster but Luca was able to learn, live with humans and fulfil his dream of riding a Vespa</p>
